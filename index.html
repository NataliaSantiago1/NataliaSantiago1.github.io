            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>My journey through the Computer Science program has been transformative, equipping me with a diverse set of technical skills and a deeper understanding of the field. This professional self-assessment serves as a formal introduction to my ePortfolio, reflecting on my accomplishments, strengths, and aspirations as I prepare to enter the computer science industry Completing my coursework and developing the ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths and shape my professional goals. The rigorous curriculum has honed my problem-solving abilities and fostered a passion for continuous learning. For example, in my Software Engineering courses, I collaborated on with instructors and classmates. This experience not only enhanced my coding skills but also reinforced the importance of effective teamwork and communication. Through various projects and assignments, I have gained practical experience in key areas such as data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. A notable project involved designing and implementing an optimized sorting algorithm, which significantly improved the performance of a data-intensive application. This hands-on experience has prepared me to tackle real-world challenges and contribute effectively to any technical team. Working in a team environment has been a cornerstone of my education. Whether it's pair programming, group assignments, or hackathons, collaboration has taught me the value of diverse perspectives and collective problem-solving. Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial in any project. Throughout my program, I have presented project updates, conducted code reviews, and participated in technical discussions. These experiences have sharpened my ability to convey complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences, ensuring alignment and clarity. Technical Competencies: Proficient in implementing and optimizing various data structures and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently. Experienced in designing, developing, and testing software applications using best practices and modern development methodologies. Skilled in designing and managing relational databases, ensuring data integrity and optimizing query performance. Knowledgeable in implementing security measures to protect applications and data from vulnerabilities and threats. The artifact selected for this enhancement is the contact manager application, which was originally created three months ago as part of my CS-320: Current Emerging Trends in Computer Science coursework. Initially, the program allowed basic operations such as adding, updating, and deleting contacts, but it faced several limitations: the contact data was stored only in memory (resulting in data loss after the program closed), and there was no user interface (requiring direct code interaction).</p>
